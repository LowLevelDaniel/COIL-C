# COIL C Compiler
ccc or the COIL C Compiler built by LLT is a simple compiler to compile C code into COIL code.

Currently targeting version 1.0.0 it will be worked on as the specification for COIL evolves.

Do not expect full gnu, c or msvc compatibility or anything crazy, even a pre-processor is a feature that may or may not be implemented.
Do not expect this to be a realistic replace to your current C compiler as of yet just a way to creat COIL code to help with COIL assembler and COIL virtual machine creation.
